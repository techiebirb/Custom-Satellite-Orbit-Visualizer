# Custom Satelite Orbit Visualization

This tools lets you see what your custom satellite orbit would look like around Earth. It is made using Python, specifically Plotly for the visualization, Flask for the web interface, and SSCWS for the data on the ISS satellite. Please note that the stars are only for aesthetic purposes and do not represent actual star positions. The same goes with the Earth texture, which is a pre-loaded image and does not show the proper conditions for the given dates and times.
